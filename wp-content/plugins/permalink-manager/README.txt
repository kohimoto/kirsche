Most advanced yet easy-to-use permalink plugin that helps to maintain & bulk change your URLs & slugs.

== Description ==

A really intuitive and easy-to-use plugin that helps to manage the permalinks for all your posts, pages and other custom post types items.

Currently, the plugin allows to perform four main actions:

1. It allows to manually adjust selected permalinks (URIs or native slugs) for all posts/pages/custom post type items.
2. It allows to bulk replace particular words used in permalinks (or native slugs) with another words (works also with substring).
3. It allows to bulk regenerate/reset permalinks (or native slugs). This might be especially useful if your post titles are updated and native slugs need to be recreated.
4. It allows to change the default permalink bases (permastructures) for all custom post types & posts and pages.

To improve the user experience, each tool allows also to filter the permalinks by post types or post statuses.

= "Find and replace" usage example =

Word "krakow" should be replaced with "gdansk" in all your permalinks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Can I delete/disable Permalink Manager after the permalinks are updated? =
A. Yes, if you used Permalink Manager only to regenerate the slugs (native post names). Please note that if you use custom permalinks (that differ from the native ones), they will no longer be used after the plugin is disabled.

It is because Permalink Manager overwrites one of the core Wordpress functionalities to bypass the rewrite rules ("regular expressions" to detect the posts/pages/taxonomies/etc. and another parameters from the URL) by using the array of custom permalinks (you can check them in "Debug" tab) that are used only by my plugin.

= Q. Can I use Permalink Manager to alter the permalinks for taxonomies?
A. This feature will be available in Permalink Manager Pro.

= Q. Does this plugin support Buddypress?
A. Currently there is no 100% guarantee that Permalink Manager will work correctly with Buddypress.
